# Rules

### 1. Do not grief

- Have an IC (in-character) reason to do things, especially violent/antagonistic acts.
- We are not a PvP/war-focused server; PvP is allowed, but we expect people to not gank each other with insufficient IC reasoning.

### 2. Keep it civil

- Keep IC arguments IC. Do not break character to attack the opposing player.
- Do not use real-life racial slurs in game.

### 3. Combat Rules

- Good-faith RP normally trumps OOC / coded mechanics - theater of the mind is important on a game like this. Regardless, IC combat should, unless agreed to otherwise, generally follow our [Combat Rules](../mechanics/combat_rules.md) to ensure fairness for everyone. 

### 4. Don't abuse bugs

- The game is heavily in-development. Issues are expected to occur.
- If you're unsure, ask about it on the Discord.
- Please report all bugs to triage for processing.
- The severity of enforcement for this rule depends on what you're doing. Something light-hearted but ultimately not harmful is not a big deal; the point to drive home is to not abuse bugs to gain an advantage over other players playing in good faith, or to otherwise ruin someone's experience.

### 5. Roleplay Limitations

- Regarding Erotic Roleplay: Don't ask, don't tell. Keep it out of public eye. Don't have it be an issue or mentioned outside of private eyes. While not explicitly log-checked for, it is not the point of the server, and you will be removed if you are being creepy.
- Any adult content involving underage themes, **whether player or character**, will result in a permanent, unappealable ban. Don't try it.
