# The Lucian Royal Bloodline

During their more than five hundred years of reign, the Lucian bloodline has been based out of their great city-stronghold of Insomnia. Bearers of incredible powers connected to their ancestors, they’re led by a King or Queen. Unbeknownst to the public, this monarch has completed a quest to gather the relics of their ancestors which consolidate their abilities and concentrate them. An Heir must complete this quest to be able to become King or Queen.

The King or Queen as well as the Heir to a more limited extent is able to divest power into loyal guardians, known as Kingsglaive. Kingsglaive are the elite warriors of Lucis, and especially older Kingsglaive are known to be incredibly formidable, comparable to Shinra’s SOLDIERs, with tricks and experience more than raw power and equipment.

Each Kingsglaive has their own style, while an Heir is pushed to develop skills in both magical and physical realms, as they’re expected to be a great paragon and champion in every way. Strong expectations are placed upon them alongside the best tutors and education possible.
