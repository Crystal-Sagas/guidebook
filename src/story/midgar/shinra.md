# The Shinra Electric Company

Shinra began ninety years ago as a family-run business within Insomnia. That business focused on technological advancements and machina, but quickly grew to grander designs and desires as the leaders of this incredibly-fast growing company turned its gaze to what they saw as the easily influenceable land of Guadosalam. They were outgrowing Insomnia, and began to try to subvert the leadership of Guadosalam, offering the convenience and ease that comes with machina-weaponry and devices. They sold this under the guise of modernization.

However, they also instigated conflict within the country that they participated in, to the point where they were disavowed and made to leave Insomnia. Shinra anticipated this, and set down new roots in Guadosalam, which then became Midgar, as they took over the country after its civil war and their subversion that started it. Within this new country, the only rules they needed to follow were their own.

Because of this, several dubious and dangerous projects were begun by minds that were given leeway to investigate any and all avenues. This included research into the extraterrestrial corpse code-named JENOVA - recovered from a faraway land, the harvesting of Mako energy from forceable energy extraction from the Lifestream, as well as using that Mako to create Materia and augmented warriors. Every avenue of thought is explored by Shinra scientists, no matter how morally dubious. The only oversight they have is their own and the demand for ‘progress’ by their superiors.

The SOLDIER program is Shinra’s elite warriors and often the very products of these avenues of research. They often have advanced equipment and rigorous training, though they can lack practical experience in many cases.
