# Arcadia

Arcadia was once a great, scholarly kingdom. However, due to unknown circumstances, the ancient kingdom was entirely obliterated ten years ago. Any survivors from this event claim that the central city exploded without warning, and they managed to escape from the surrounding areas before monstrous creatures took over the area. Venturing into the area is ill-advised as it’s heavily polluted by dangerous and unstable aurora-like magic and dangerous monsters.

No expedition into the ruins of Arcadia has been successful at penetrating near to the ancient central city and origin point of the explosion. There was a larger push initially to investigate by several parties, but after so many failed attempts interest waned. Those still willing to try are few and don’t receive much support from their home country.
