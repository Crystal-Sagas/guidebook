# The Lifestream Crystal (Mako)

The Lifestream Crystal is a theorized object that serves as the opposite to the Aether Crystal. The Lifestream is the world’s memories, the aspect of ‘life’, ‘memory’ and ‘identity’ that forms the very basis for natural life within the world. Any hypothesized crystal associated with it is disconnected from this world but in a similar vein exists everywhere where life exists.

All when they die enter the Lifestream and become one with the planet, moving to be ‘purified’ by Aether briefly, cleansing them and starting them as a fresh state to be given form, while the essence of who they were remains in the Lifestream, as it’s ‘detached’ from them due to the Aetherial touch.

Shinra, inspired by the stable existence of Insomnia built around the Aether Crystal, aims to use the Lifestream to provide them power directly. This is more difficult, owing to what the Lifestream is and its disconnect from the natural elements, but it is not impossible. To do this, they ‘dig’ into the Lifestream with their reactors, producing Mako energy, at the cost of damaging the Lifestream.
