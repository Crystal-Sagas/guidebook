# The Aether Crystal

The Aether Crystal exists within the world as the source of Insomnia’s power. In ancient times, the Lucis Caelum family bonded with it, gaining its blessing and power, in exchange for protecting and safeguarding the crystal. Insomnia was built around the crystal, and in the present day the Aether Crystal is a heavily fortified item that’s directly connected into Insomnia’s defenses.

It is able to animate the statues and raise the protective shield around the city. It also provides the Lucis Caelum line their unique abilities, and some covet their royal lineage’s power without really understanding its basis as an agreement and pact with the Crystal.

Aether is a type of energy that’s opposite that of the Lifestream, forming aspects aside from life, memory and identity that the Lifestream offers. Aether is instead ‘death’ and the elemental essences of the world, the crystal serving as a ‘node’ within that system of the world, and is important for the stability of the elements and natural forces, though like any crystal, it cannot be permanently destroyed and will reform elsewhere - but cause disruption and problems until it stabilizes fully.
