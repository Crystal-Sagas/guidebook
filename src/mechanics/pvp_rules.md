# PvP

**This section is heavily WIP.** We do not encourage lethal PvP, as it is not the point of the ongoing wipe.

Two types of PvP engagements are generally allowable:

- Open Engagements: When encountering someone on the world map/otherwise. These are **Threat Level 2, at most**, as agreed upon by the parties.
- Closed Engagements: **Must be agreed to by all parties**: These are **Threat Level 4, at most**, as agreed upon by the parties.

If you've noticed that PvP is only lethal when agreed upon (or in an event), you would be correct.

## Roleplay

Some additional points regarding PvP instances, especially spontaneous ones, are as follows:

- Not all PvP must be mechanical, turn-based. If the involved parties agree to something else, they are allowed to perform the given instance as long as it makes sense.
- Starting a PvP encounter, much like any other roleplayed scenario, automatically means anyone ICly in the immediate vicinity may join. 
- PvP encounters may be initiated outside of agreed areas / from encountering someone on the map, within reason.
    - This usually requires both sides to engage in RP. Just walking outside of town and wanting to beat up the first person you see going around gathering nodes with no prior justification is not going to work out.

## Danger

Some additional points regarding danger levels are as follows:

- The winning side does not **have to** enforce Death Saving Throws upon the losing side, even if they agreed upon a lethal encounter.
- Any long term / persistent harm done to a side, including mugging/etc, automatically escalates the encounter to a **Danger Level 2**.

## Fleeing

**These are only for PvP enconuters, not events.** The event runner may choose to use these, or not, as per usual for event handling.

To flee an encounter, each party member that is not KO'd makes a **DEX** roll. The total results are compared - the fleeing party needs to have a higher roll to get away.

- A Flee attempt takes the full turn action of each member involved.
- KO'd individuals may not make the roll.
- Persuing characters sacrifice their next **standard** action, as opposed to full, to make this roll..
    - If they are unable to perform their standard action, they may not make the roll. This means that if the entire party is stunned/otherwise, they cannot persue.
- **If someone is excluded from the roll, the fleeing party may designate one person of the persuing party per exclusion to skip their roll as well.**

## Resolution

PvP instances generally end, much like other encounters, when one side is fully KO'd.

### Ceasefires

PvP instances may end by both sides agreeing to a cease-fire.

- **Everyone** must agree to this to end an encounter this way. If a party member is in disagreement, they must be handled, one way or another.

### Defeat

Being defeated generally means that the winner may do to the loser as per the danger level.

- **Any** fully lethal action requires Danger 3+.
- **Any** major, long-term injury/maiming requires Danger 2+.
- **Capturing / Mugging** requires Danger 2.

### Capture

The winning party may enforce capture status upon the losing, in a dangerous encounter.

- Only **major factions** (currently Midgar/Insomnia's militaries) may capture people. Normal individuals cannot simply chain someone to their basement.
- This generally requires coordination and RP, as the game does not **have** a true 'capture' system in its code.

### Mugging

This is not a thing in this game at this point in time.

### Injury

This is not a thing in this game at this point in time.
