# Ranks

## Character Ranks

In Crystal Sagas, characters are a given **rank** based on how much RPP (roleplay perk points) they have.

The RPP system is not quite mature, but is what we are using until a better system may replace it.

The current ranks are:

- Fledgeling - New characters start at this
- Rookie - At 50 RPP
- Adept - At 80 RPP
- Veteran - At 100 RPP, **after** a Veteran mission
- Master - At 150 RPP
- Hero - At 200 RPP

Ranks determine what perks and abilities you may purchase.

## Perks / Ability Levels

Perks and Abilities currently come in levels:

- T1 to T6 for Perks
- E to S rank for Abilities

This system is also not mature, and may be updated in the future.
